## **Description** 👀

A `Kafka` cluster is composed of multiple `brokers` (servers). Each `broker` is identified with its ID (integer). Each `broker` contains certain `topic partitions`. Partitions are distributed across all the `brokers` in the `Kafka` cluster. This is what makes `Kafka` scale, and is called ***horizontal scaling***.
