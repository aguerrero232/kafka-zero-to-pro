## **Description** 👀


`Topics` are a *particular* stream of **data**, like a table in a database (without the constraints). You can have as many topics as you want, and is identified by its **name**. `Topics` also support **any** message format. The sequence of messages in a `topic` is called a `data stream`. You can not query a `topic` directly, but you can use a `consumer` to read the `data stream` from the `topic`. Similarly `Kafka` uses a `producer` to write the `data stream` to the `topic`.
